# Machine Learning/Data Science Practice Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts I wrote while learning and practicing different **machine learning algorithms** using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and general data science/statistics.

The goal of this repo is to build up a collection of small, focused scripts that demonstrate:
- Training models
- Evaluating performance
- Working with common datasets
- Comparing different algorithms

## Current Scripts

### 1. Logistic Regression on Wine Dataset
- Uses the **Wine dataset** (3 wine classes).
- Workflow:
  - Train/test split
  - Feature scaling
  - Logistic regression training
  - Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
